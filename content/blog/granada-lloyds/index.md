For Renee's birthday party, we are making **Banana Tarte Tatin with Spiced Rum Cream** from _Ainsley's Caribbean Kitchen_.

The rum cream will be on the side for kiddies and non-drinkers :).

This dessert is a tropical twist on a French classic, featuring caramelized bananas nestled in a rich, spiced sauce and baked with flaky puff pastry. It’s served with a dollop of decadent spiced rum cream for a truly indulgent finish.
